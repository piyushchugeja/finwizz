            - Miscellaneous payments that don't fit into the above categories should be categorized as "Miscellaneous".
            - Payments to individuals (like friends or family) should be categorized as "Transfers" if they are not brand handles.
            - Salary or income sources should be categorized as "Salary".
            - If the category isn't clear, default to "Miscellaneous" but give a sensible note.
